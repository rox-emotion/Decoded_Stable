                        De.Coded is a research-based exploration of the human capital of Silicon Valley. The four-year project was built on the foundation of a year-long nomination process, where a diverse group of local leaders nominated individuals from their own communities who are making significant contributions to the region and represent the very best of service to society. The final 101 nominees frame many of the most important stories of this remarkable valley. However, they represent only a fraction of the Bay area’s exceptional residents.
                        The project maps these remarkable people though photographic portraits, oral histories and ancestral DNA mapping to create a deeper understanding of the peninsula and beyond. The Human Atlas project holds a mirror up to society and encourages audiences to question their own roles and responsibilities to their communities, cities, and fellow human beings.
                        The work is available as a book, a museum exhibition and in multiple digital formats.
