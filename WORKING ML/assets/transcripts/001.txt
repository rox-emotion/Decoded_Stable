My name is Tan Le. I'm a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, and an
entrepreneur.
Every moment, I am enthralled by the capacity for people to imagine a new
future. Every few years there's a new fresh wave of thinking, a new fresh set of
ideas.... and it's very reinvigorating for someone like myself, who has really
spent most of my life
going through multiple transformational journeys. I also
started with nothing, and so that is a very big part of what makes me who I am,
and how I think about the world.
My family's history is really interesting because we are migrants. My mother
left Vietnam in 1981 in search of a better future for her two children. It was all
about being able to shape and define a future for yourself, irrespective of the
circumstances in which you find yourself at the very beginning.
I think I've carried with me in my life a very deep sense of responsibility for the
future. I'm really interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
physical world. That intersection point between the two. It's funny, I named my
daughter Ai. Which is spelt 'A-I', but it actually means love and I think that this
is, this moment in time it's about reconnecting with the things that matter most
to you, but also recognizing that the future is going to be really transformative.
That technology is going to continue to drive huge amounts of innovation, 
transformation about what it means to be human.... and that's what I'm really
excited about. Redefining what it means to be human.
