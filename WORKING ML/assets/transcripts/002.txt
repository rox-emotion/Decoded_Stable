I'm Sophia Kianni, and I'm a 20 year old Iranian American climate activist.
Both of my parents grew up and were born in Iran. They both left most of their
family in Iran, so I grew up visiting Iran on the summers and it was my
experiences in Iran that actually pushed me to become a climate activist,
because I was able to firsthand
witness what air pollution and the climate crisis
were doing to Iran, in a way that I had never seen in the United States.
My dad would always go outside with me and my sister, and we would go look
at the night sky and star gaze.... and so when I went to
Iran, I missed my dad,
and that was our tradition.... and so I would go out onto my grandmother's
balcony to go look at the stars. I was struck by how horrible the smog was and I
learned that the air pollution had been hospitalizing people. It was very bad
for
the health of different Iranians. This was right after my sixth grade class where I
learned what climate change even was.... and so it was incredibly horrifying and
it really put an image to the obscure topics that I had seen in my textbooks.
I broug
ht up my concerns with my relatives, and I was shocked when they told
me they had never learned about global warming. They didn't really know what
I was talking about, and so I wanted to teach them, but I was unable to find
resources available in Farsi. Wh
ich is their native language.... and so I worked
with my mom to translate resources and I was able to have this enormous
impact, when my relatives were amazed by the fact that I was educating them
on a topic they had previously not heard about.
I learned t
hat nine out of the 10 countries that are worse impacted by climate
change are a majority non
-
English speaking. The only one that was a majority
English speaking was Canada. I came up with this idea to start Climate
Cardinals, because I wanted to be able t
o inform more people like my relatives
who were experiencing the brunt of the climate crisis. On our first day, we had
over a thousand people sign up to volunteer with us. Now that number is more
than 8,000 volunteers from over 40 countries around the worl
d.... and to be able
to catch the eye of the UN Secretary General of all people.... and to be asked for
my advice on his climate strategy, really was such a full circle moment for me,
and it showed that we all should be maintaining a sense of hope and opti
mism
because young people are actually being taken seriously.... and there's no reason
that any other young person can't do the work that I did.
